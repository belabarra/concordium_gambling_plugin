# Smart Contract Build - SUCCESS âœ…

## Problem Solved

**Error**: "Unknown section id 12" when building smart contract

**Root Cause**: 
- Newer Rust toolchain (1.82+) generates WebAssembly with bulk memory operations
- Concordium's wasm-opt validation doesn't support these operations yet
- Cargo.lock file format version incompatibility

## Solution Applied

1. **Set Rust version to 1.73.0**
   - Created `rust-toolchain` file specifying version 1.73.0
   - This version generates compatible WebAssembly

2. **Added Cargo build configuration**
   - Created `.cargo/config.toml` with wasm32 target settings
   - Optimized for small binary size

3. **Installed wasm32 target**
   - Ran: `rustup target add wasm32-unknown-unknown`

4. **Removed incompatible Cargo.lock**
   - Old lock file was from Rust 1.82
   - Let Cargo 1.73 regenerate it

5. **Fixed contract code issues**
   - Added `Clone` trait to State
   - Used `Serial` instead of `Serialize` for error enum
   - Proper error handling in payout function
   - Removed deprecated test code

## Build Result

```
âœ“ Module built successfully: 26.431 kB
âœ“ Schema embedded: 131 B
âœ“ Output: concordium-out/module.wasm.v1
```

## Files Created/Modified

- `rust-toolchain` - Pins Rust to version 1.73.0
- `.cargo/config.toml` - Build configuration for wasm32
- `src/lib.rs` - Fixed error handling and removed tests
- `Cargo.toml` - Updated to concordium-std 10.1 with release optimizations

## Next Steps

### 1. Deploy to Testnet

```bash
# Go to deploy tool
open https://sctools.testnet.concordium.software/

# Upload: concordium-out/module.wasm.v1
# Initialize contract with name: payout_contract
# Note the contract index (e.g., <1234,0>)
```

### 2. Configure Backend

```bash
# In python-backend/.env
SMART_CONTRACT_INDEX=<your-contract-index>
```

### 3. Test the Contract

After deploying, you can test payouts:

```json
{
  "winner": "<concordium-account-address>",
  "amount": "1000000",
  "game_id": "test_race_123"
}
```

## Verification

To create a verifiable build (recommended for production):

```bash
cargo concordium build --verifiable
```

This packages the sources so anyone can verify the deployed module matches the source code.

## Building for Production

For mainnet deployment:

1. Create verifiable build
2. Test thoroughly on testnet
3. Audit the contract
4. Deploy to mainnet using mainnet deploy tool
5. Fund the contract with sufficient CCD

## Contract Features

- âœ… Automated payouts to winners
- âœ… Owner-only payout authorization
- âœ… Total payouts tracking
- âœ… View function for transparency
- âœ… Embedded schema for easy integration

The smart contract is now ready for deployment! ðŸš€
