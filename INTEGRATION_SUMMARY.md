# Integration Complete - System Summary

## Current Status: ALL SYSTEMS RUNNING

Your Concordium responsible gambling platform is now fully integrated and operational!

### Running Services:

1. Frontend (React + Vite) - http://localhost:5174
2. Python Backend (FastAPI) - http://localhost:8000
3. Node.js Backend (Express) - http://localhost:3000
4. Concordium Testnet - Connected

---

## What Changed (High-Level Overview)

### PROBLEM:
Before, your components were built but disconnected:
- Frontend talked directly to blockchain (bypassing responsible gambling features)
- Python backend couldn't communicate with Concordium (no Python SDK exists)
- No user registration, session tracking, or limit enforcement

### SOLUTION:
Implemented a three-tier architecture to connect everything:

```
Frontend → Python Backend → Node.js Backend → Concordium Blockchain
   ↓            ↓                  ↓                    ↓
  UI     Responsible Gambling   Blockchain Bridge   CCD Payments
         (Limits, Sessions,     (SDK Translation)
         Self-Exclusion)
```

---

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Node.js Backend (Bridge to Blockchain)

**Why:** Python has no official Concordium SDK, so Node.js acts as a translator

**Files Created/Modified:**
- node-backend/src/services/concordiumService.ts - Blockchain communication service
- node-backend/src/routes/concordiumRoutes.ts - API endpoints for Python to call
- node-backend/src/server.ts - Mounted routes

**Critical Fix:**
- Changed from credentials.createInsecure() to credentials.createSsl() for testnet connection
- This was THE fix that made blockchain connectivity work

### 2. Frontend Integration (Added Responsible Gambling)

**Why:** Original frontend bypassed all your responsible gambling features

**Files Created:**
- Frontend/src/services/apiClient.ts - Complete API client for Python backend (600+ lines)
- Frontend/src/context/UserContext.tsx - User session management (400+ lines)
- Frontend/.env - Environment configuration

**Files Modified:**
- Frontend/src/components/HorseRacing.tsx - Replaced with integrated version
- Frontend/src/App.tsx - Added UserContextProvider wrapper
- Frontend/src/components/HorseRacing.css - Added registration form styling

**New User Flow:**
1. User registers (name, age, wallet address)
2. User starts gambling session
3. BEFORE each bet: System checks self-exclusion + spending limits
4. IF approved: Blockchain transaction proceeds
5. AFTER bet: Session statistics updated in database

### 3. Python Backend (Fixed Import Issues)

**Why:** Python 3.14 compatibility + module import errors

**Fixes Applied:**
- Fixed 30+ files with incorrect import paths (config. → src.config.)
- Upgraded pydantic to 2.12.3 (Python 3.14 support)
- Renamed metadata column to extra_data (SQLAlchemy reserved word conflict)
- Added CORS for Frontend ports (5173, 5174)

**Database:**
- Auto-initialized SQLite database with all tables
- Location: python-backend/responsible_gambling.db

## How It Works Now

### User Journey:

1. Frontend loads at http://localhost:5174
2. User connects wallet (Concordium Browser Wallet)
3. Age verification using zero-knowledge proofs
4. User registers → POST to Python backend /api/v1/users/register
5. Session starts → POST to Python backend /api/v1/sessions/start
6. User places bet:
   - Frontend calls Python backend → checks self-exclusion
   - Python backend checks spending limits
   - If approved → Frontend sends CCD transaction to blockchain
   - Transaction hash → Python backend via Node.js for verification
   - Session stats updated
7. Session ends → POST to Python backend /api/v1/sessions/end

### Data Flow Example (Placing a Bet):

```
1. HorseRacing.tsx → checkSelfExclusion()
   → POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/self-exclusion/check

2. HorseRacing.tsx → checkSpendingLimit(100 CCD)
   → POST http://localhost:8000/api/v1/limits/check

3. If both pass → sendTransaction()
   → Concordium SDK → Blockchain

4. HorseRacing.tsx → updateSessionStats(wagered: 100)
   → PUT http://localhost:8000/api/v1/sessions/:id/stats
```

## Technical Details (For Your Team)

### Architecture Pattern:
- Adapter Pattern: Node.js bridges Python ↔ Concordium
- Service Layer: Separation of routes, services, repositories
- Context API: React state management (UserContext + WalletContext)

### API Communication:
- RESTful HTTP/JSON between all layers
- Promise-based async/await throughout
- Generic TypeScript types for type safety

### Environment Variables:
- Frontend: VITE_API_URL=http://localhost:8000 (Frontend/.env)
- Python: CONCORDIUM_SERVICE_URL=http://localhost:3000 (python-backend/src/config/settings.py)

---

## To Run The System

### Terminal 1 - Node.js Backend:
```bash
cd node-backend
npm install  # (if needed)
npm start
```
Should see: "Server running on port 3000"

### Terminal 2 - Python Backend:
```bash
cd python-backend
pip install -r requirements.txt  # (if needed)
python -m uvicorn src.main:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000 --reload
```
Should see: "Database initialized successfully"

### Terminal 3 - Frontend:
```bash
cd Frontend
npm install  # (if needed)
npm run dev
```
Should see: "Local: http://localhost:5173/" (or 5174)

### Health Check:
```bash
curl http://localhost:3000/api/concordium/health  # Node.js + Blockchain
curl http://localhost:8000/api/v1/health          # Python
```

## API Documentation

- Python Backend Swagger Docs: http://localhost:8000/docs
- Node.js Health: http://localhost:3000/api/health
- Concordium Service: http://localhost:3000/api/concordium/health

## Important Notes

1. Blockchain Connection: Using Concordium testnet, SSL/TLS required
2. Python Version: Requires Python 3.13+ (tested on 3.14)
3. Frontend Port: May use 5173 or 5174 depending on availability
4. Database: SQLite auto-created on first run (no setup needed)
5. Wallet: Users need Concordium Browser Wallet extension installed

---

## Testing The Full Flow

1. Open http://localhost:5174 in browser
2. Connect your Concordium wallet
3. Verify age (must be 18+)
4. Register with name and wallet address
5. Session starts automatically
6. Place a bet on a horse
7. Check database to verify session/transaction recorded

---

## Troubleshooting

**Frontend can't connect to backend:**
- Check CORS settings in python-backend/src/config/settings.py (line 48)
- Verify VITE_API_URL in Frontend/.env

**Blockchain connection fails:**
- Check Node.js logs for gRPC errors
- Verify internet connection (needs testnet access)

**Python import errors:**
- All imports should use src. prefix
- Run the import fix script if needed

---

## Dependencies Added

**Frontend:**
- @concordium/react-components (for wallet integration)

**Python Backend:**
- Upgraded pydantic to 2.12.3
- Upgraded fastapi to 0.115.0

**Node.js Backend:**
- @concordium/web-sdk (blockchain communication)
- Using CommonJS (require()) for SDK compatibility

## Ready for Hackathon Demo!

Your responsible gambling system is now fully functional with:
- User registration and session tracking
- Self-exclusion checks
- Spending limit enforcement
- Blockchain payment integration
- Complete audit trail in database

The system preserves your original horse racing UI while adding responsible gambling features transparently in the background.

Good luck with your Concordium hackathon presentation!
